        Macbook Air
        <hr>
    </h3>
    <div class="blog-content">
        <h1>Developer Preview</h1>
        <p>The MacBook Air is a lightweight laptop developed by Apple and first released in 2008.

            It features a thin and durable design, with a high-resolution Retina display and a responsive trackpad with
            Force Touch technology.

            The latest version of the MacBook Air, released in 2020, comes with an Apple-designed M1 chip for improved
            performance and longer battery life.

            It also features a Magic Keyboard with backlit keys and a Touch ID sensor for easy and secure
            authentication.


        </p>
        <h3>platform_stability</h3>
        <p>The MacBook Air runs on macOS, Apple's operating system, and comes with built-in apps such as Safari, Mail,
            and iMovie.

            Overall, the MacBook Air is a powerful and versatile laptop that is ideal for everyday use, whether you're
            browsing the web, creating content, or working on the go.</p>
        <h3>Beta 1</h3>
        <p>Beta 1 gives you a more complete and stable environment for building and testing on Android 14, and it's the
            first build that we deliver to early adopters who are enrolled in the Android Beta program. During the Beta
            releases period, early adopters will be using your app on Pixel devices,
        </p>
        <p>
            so we recommend watching for feedback from those users and releasing compatible updates to address any
            issues, without changing the app's targeting. It's also a good time to begin preparing for changing your
            app's targeting later.

        </p>
        <div class="fact-card">
            <span>
                <ion-icon name="help-circle"></ion-icon>
                <h4>Important</h4>
            </span>
            <p>For SDKs and library developers: targeting Platform Stability for final testing is critical. Downstream
                app and game developers might be blocked until their bundled SDKs and libraries are updated to support
                Android 14.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Grammatical Inflection API</h3>
        <p>The Grammatical Inflection API allows you to more easily add support for users who speak languages where
            grammatical gender changes the sentence based on the person being addressed, providing a more personalized
            and natural-sounding user experience for those languages.
        </p>
        <h5>Example of inflection for grammatical gender</h5>
        <p>Grammatical gender is integral to some languages and can't be easily worked around like in English. For
            example, in English to write a message telling the user that they are subscribed to your app's service, you
            could use a single phrase: "You are subscribed to...".</p>
        <div class="fact-card">
            <span>
                <ion-icon name="help-circle"></ion-icon>
                <h4>Did you know</h4>
            </span>
            <p>Android Studio doesn't currently have tooling for this feature but will in a future preview release. In
                the meantime, we wanted to give you a chance to evaluate the APIs to provide feedback and to start
                assessing infrastructural changes that will be required to add support in your app.</p>
        </div>
        <h5>Request install approval before downloading</h5>
        <p>Installing or updating an app may require user approval. For example, when an installer making use of the
            REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission attempts to install a new app. In prior Android versions, app stores can
            only request user approval after APKs are written to the install session and the session is committed.</p>
        <p>
            Any other installer, including those making use of the INSTALL_PACKAGES permission, must receive explicit
            user approval in order to install an update. If a user decides to proceed with an update from another
            source, update ownership is lost.
        </p>
        <h5>Detect when users take device screenshots</h5>
        <p>To create a more standardized experience for detecting screenshots, Android 14 introduces a
            privacy-preserving screenshot detection API. This API lets apps register callbacks on a per-activity basis.
            These callbacks are invoked, and the user is notified, when the user takes a screenshot while that activity
            is visible.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            In conclusion,Based on the available information, it appears that Android 14 is a highly anticipated
            operating system that is set to launch in mid-2023. The focus of this new OS seems to be on enhancing user
            experience, with improvements that will make the smartphone more efficient and effective.
        </p>

        <p>Overall, Android 14 promises to be a significant update for Android users and is expected to deliver
            improvements across the board.</p>

        <p>Thank you for reading! </p>
